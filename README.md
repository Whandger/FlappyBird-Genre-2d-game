## 🧩 Technologies Used

### 🧱 HTML
A minimal structure containing:
- Game area (`<div id="gameArea">`)
- Obstacles, bird, and restart/start buttons.

### 🎨 CSS
Simple but effective styling for:
- Game layout and background.
- Obstacle and bird positioning.
- Basic animations and transitions.
- Background image setup for the infinite scrolling effect.

### ⚙️ JavaScript
Handles all the game logic:
- Physics (gravity, velocity, collision detection).
- Scoring and obstacle repositioning.
- Background movement using `transform` and smooth rotation with `rotate()`.
- Event listeners for keyboard (`keydown`) and mobile (`touchstart`) input.
